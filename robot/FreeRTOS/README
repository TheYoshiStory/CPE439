This project includes all of the code for running FreeRTOS v8.2.3 on the
Digilent ZYBO board when compiling with the Xilinx SDK.

NOTES:
heap_4.c is one of 5 heap implementations included in FreeRTOS.  The others
provide various features and can be found by downloading FreeRTOS v8.2.3 from
the project website.  See http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html for more details.
If you are not sure what any of this means do not worry; know that the project
is configured such that all FreeRTOS features will work as expected by default.
